# Transports
Simple inventory-manager C application for tracking a transport company's shipments.

The application can store and load data from a selected txt file, or it can create a new file to use.

It's possible to filter by each datatype, or find the maximum values in a file.

The application is completely command-line based with a menu controlled by arrow keys.
